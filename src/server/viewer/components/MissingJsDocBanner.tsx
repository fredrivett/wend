const JSDOC_AGENT_PROMPT = `Your task is to add JSDoc comments to TypeScript source files until the project reaches 100% JSDoc coverage.

## What "symbols" means

Symbols are the TypeScript constructs that syncdocs tracks: functions, classes, interfaces, type aliases, enums, and constants. Only **exported** symbols require a /** ... */ JSDoc comment directly above their declaration. Non-exported (file-private) symbols do not need JSDoc.

## Feedback loop

syncdocs tells you what's missing. Run:

  npx syncdocs jsdoc

to see current JSDoc coverage and the list of symbols still missing comments. Repeat until it reports 100%.

## Process

Work file by file, not symbol by symbol:

1. Run \`npx syncdocs jsdoc --verbose\` to get the list of symbols missing JSDoc, grouped by file.
2. For each file in the list:
   a. Read the source file.
   b. Add a JSDoc comment above every exported symbol that is missing one. Skip non-exported symbols.
   c. If a symbol's purpose is unclear from its name, signature, and body, read its generated doc in \`_syncdocs/\` for context on callers and callees.
   d. Do NOT change any code — only add JSDoc comments.
3. After all files are done, run the project's formatter and linter (e.g. \`npm run format\`).
4. Run \`npx syncdocs sync\` to regenerate docs, then \`npx syncdocs jsdoc\` to verify coverage.
5. If any symbols were missed, fix them and repeat step 4.
6. Commit with a message like: \`docs: add JSDoc comments across codebase\`

## Writing JSDoc comments

- First line: a concise summary of what the symbol does (imperative for functions, descriptive for types/constants).
- Body (optional): explain behavior, side effects, or non-obvious details. Omit if the name and signature make it clear.
- \`@param name - description\` — only for parameters whose purpose, constraints, or defaults are not obvious from their name and type. Do not repeat the type.
- \`@returns\` — only when the return value is non-obvious from the signature.
- \`@throws\` — only when the error behavior is meaningful to callers.
- \`@example\` — only when usage is non-obvious.
- Keep comments brief. Do not pad with filler. Engineers can read code — focus on WHY, not restating WHAT.
- Use inline code backticks for parameter names, types, and values in descriptions.
- Match the existing code style (check for single/double quotes, indent size, semicolons, etc.)

## Important

- Only add JSDoc comments. Do not modify function bodies, signatures, or any other code.
- If a symbol already has a JSDoc comment, skip it.
- If you're unsure what a function does, read its call graph in the syncdocs output and the function body carefully before writing the comment.`;
